Concurrent Library
-------------------------------

This example benchmarks a concurrent library (the one for books).

  make small-bench

Runs a small benchmark that takes approximately 1 minute
to finish. The results are stored time-stamped in data/.

  make small-plot

Produces two plots of the small benchmark data. It
automatically chooses the latest timestamped run in data/.

You can use run_nebula.sh to automatically copy your .zip
archive to nebula and run some make target there. The syntax is

  run_nebula.sh [project.zip] [Makefile target]

The gathered data is then automatically scp'd back into your
data/ folder.

Prerequisites
-----------------------------

What is needed:

* C compiler
* GNU Make
* Python version at least 3.6
